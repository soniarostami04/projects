This repository is a personal portfolio documenting cybersecurity skills developed during my participation in the National Cyber League (NCL).

All content in this repository reflects my:
- Personal project recreations
- Tools and techniques I learned and applied
- Original write-ups and reflections based on memory and experience

❌ No proprietary NCL content (including flags, prompts, PCAPs, or challenge-specific files) has been included.
✅ This project is intended solely for educational and professional development purposes.

If you're participating in NCL or any CTF, please adhere to ethical guidelines and academic honesty.
