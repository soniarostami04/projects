## 📂 Challenge Categories

### 🔍 Forensics
Used Autopsy to investigate image files, recover deleted content, and trace metadata for attribution.

### 🌐 Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
Performed email, domain, and image-based searches to extract hidden intel from public sources.

### 🔐 Password Cracking
Decrypted hashed passwords using dictionary and brute-force attacks on Linux systems.

### 🔒 Cryptography
Decoded encrypted messages including Caesar and substitution ciphers using custom scripts.

### 📶 Network Traffic Analysis
Inspected packet captures in Wireshark to identify anomalies, suspicious behavior, and embedded data.

### 📜 Log Analysis
Analyzed server and event logs to detect insider threats, failed login attempts, and unauthorized access.

### 📡 Scanning & Recon
Scanned targets using Nmap to discover open ports and fingerprint services and vulnerabilities.

### 💣 Exploitation & Web App Security
Explored vulnerabilities in services and web applications to understand exploitation tactics.
